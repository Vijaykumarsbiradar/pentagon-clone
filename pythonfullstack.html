A full stack developer works with client-side and server-side technologies.

Python is a versatile language, making it suitable for web development.

On the back-end, Python frameworks like Django and Flask are widely used.

Django is a high-level framework that follows the MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern.

Flask is a micro-framework that gives more flexibility and minimalism.

The front-end usually includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue can be integrated with Python back-ends.

Full stack developers need to know databases too.

Python commonly works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MongoDB.

Full stack means connecting the database to the back-end.

Then delivering processed data to the front-end for users.

Django ORM allows developers to interact with databases using Python classes.

Flask usually works with SQLAlchemy for database operations.

Front-end development focuses on user experience.

HTML provides structure of web pages.

CSS styles the web content.

JavaScript adds interactivity.

Bootstrap can help in responsive web design.

Tailwind CSS is another modern styling framework.

A Python full stack developer must know REST API development.

REST APIs allow communication between client and server.

Django REST Framework (DRF) is commonly used for APIs.

Flask also supports building APIs with Flask-RESTful.

JSON is the most common data format for APIs.

AJAX can be used to call APIs asynchronously.

Modern apps often use JWT tokens for authentication.

OAuth is also used for secure authentication.

Back-end logic handles user login, registration, and sessions.

Front-end forms collect user inputs.

The server validates and processes these inputs.

Security is a key aspect of full stack development.

Django includes built-in security protections.

Flask requires manual security implementations.

CSRF protection prevents malicious requests.

HTTPS ensures encrypted communication.

Passwords should be hashed, not stored as plain text.

Python provides libraries like bcrypt for hashing.

Full stack developers should also know deployment.

Deployment means hosting your project online.

Python apps can be deployed on Heroku.

They can also be hosted on AWS, Azure, or GCP.

Docker helps in containerizing applications.

CI/CD pipelines automate deployment processes.

Git and GitHub are essential for version control.

A full stack developer collaborates using Git workflows.

Branching strategies help teams work together.

Pull requests enable code review.

Pythonâ€™s ecosystem supports testing.

Django has a built-in testing framework.

Flask projects often use pytest for testing.

Unit testing ensures small components work correctly.

Integration testing checks end-to-end workflows.

Selenium can be used for browser automation testing.

API testing ensures endpoints behave as expected.</p>
